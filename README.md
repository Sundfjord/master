rockEnroll is a web application designed to help coaches and players on organized sports teams to communicate better. Coaches can set up all the practice (or game) events for the upcoming season in minutes, and players can change their attendance status for each event. Coaches can easily edit each event individually or all events of a certain type. They can also manage the squad and staff, as well as getting access to automatically generated statistics on who showed up the most within a certain period of time.

Forget texting everyone to ask if they'll attend tonight's practice or letting the coach know you're sick by email, instead, just rockEnroll!
